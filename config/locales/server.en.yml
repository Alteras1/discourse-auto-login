    auto_login_strategy: >
      'redirect' will redirect the user to the IdP. 'iframe' will load the IdP login in a hidden iframe.
      If using 'iframe', ensure your IdP supports being loaded in an iframe and CORS is configured correctly (if applicable).
      Modern browsers may block third-party cookies in iframes, which can prevent this from working. 'iframe' works
      best when the Discourse and IdP are on the same root domain (e.g. discourse.example.com and sso.example.com).
    auto_login_days_cooldown_after_logout: >
      Number of days to prevent auto-login after a user logs out. This prevents users from being
      automatically logged back in immediately after they log out. Minimum is 1 day, maximum is 365 days.
